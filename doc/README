BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override extension README

What is the BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override extension?
================================

BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override is a true eZ Publish extension that
provides an improved modified copy of the default 'eZRole' kernel
class which provides a new method called hasPolicy.

This is a copy of the kernel/classes/ezrole.php PHP class from eZ Publish GitHub master
8a25d8730ec06cb4cbcdb9d47f13dca8b3fe9aab modified to provide hasPolicy method by default.

This complete class modified to provide additional features is provided as a implmentation
for kernel override extensions (using eZ Publish 4.x+) or kernel patches (using eZ Publish
3.x or some other non-standard configuration).

The hasPolicy method is based on lessons learned reviewing the existing methods policyList and removePolicy.

This file is a modified copy of this version, Based on: https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish/blob/8a25d8730ec06cb4cbcdb9d47f13dca8b3fe9aab/kernel/classes/ezrole.php

This solution originated in the following forum request, http://share.ez.no/forums/general/role-has-policy#comment73184

With this solution you can use eZRole directly to check for a specific policy within any eZ Publish PHP context.

This extension is a minimal kernel override extension.

============

Example PHP usage (Any eZ Publish PHP context be it cli, module view, class, kernel override, etc)

This works for any PHP context when the kernel overrides direct usage of eZRole class to the kernel override extension eZRole class provided instead directly and with all required standard eZRole usage retained completely (no deviation in expected or desired behavior only new helpful functionality)

Here is a most basic use case PHP snippet which has been successfully tested to perform as expected

$anonymous = eZRole::fetchByName('anonymous');

if ( $anonymous->hasPolicy( 'content', 'create' ) )
{
    echo 'has content,create policy';
}
else
{
    echo 'does not have content,create policy';
}

echo "\n\n";

if ( $anonymous->hasPolicy( 'content', 'read' ) )
{
    echo 'has content,read policy';
}
else
{
    echo 'does not have content,read policy';
}
