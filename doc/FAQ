FAQ

1. This extension provides something the default 'eZRole' kernel class of eZ Publish does not provide today, 'hasPolicy' method support.

This complete class modified to provide additional features is provided as a implmentation for kernel override extensions (using eZ Publish 4.x+) or kernel patches (using eZ Publish 3.x or some other non-standard configuration).

The hasPolicy method is based on lessons learned reviewing the existing methods policyList and removePolicy.
