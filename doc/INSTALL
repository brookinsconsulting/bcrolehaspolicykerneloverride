BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override extension INSTALL

Introduction
============

1. What is the BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override extension?
   ------------------------------------------------

   BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override is a true eZ Publish extension that
   provides an improved modified copy of the default 'eZRole' kernel
   class which provides a new method called hasPolicy.

   This is a copy of the kernel/classes/ezrole.php PHP class from eZ Publish GitHub master
   8a25d8730ec06cb4cbcdb9d47f13dca8b3fe9aab modified to provide hasPolicy method by default.

   This complete class modified to provide additional features is provided as a implmentation
   for kernel override extensions (using eZ Publish 4.x+) or kernel patches (using eZ Publish
   3.x or some other non-standard configuration).

   The hasPolicy method is based on lessons learned reviewing the existing methods policyList and removePolicy.

   This file is a modified copy of this version, Based on: https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish/blob/8a25d8730ec06cb4cbcdb9d47f13dca8b3fe9aab/kernel/classes/ezrole.php

   This solution originated in the following forum request, http://share.ez.no/forums/general/role-has-policy#comment73184

   With this solution you can use eZRole directly to check for a specific policy within any eZ Publish PHP context.

   This extension is a minimal kernel override extension.

   For more information about this extension please read the doc/README file.

2. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override extension:

   o  eZ publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ publish version 4.x or higher.

      eZ Publish 2011.12 (4.6+) is recommended.

   o  PHP version:

      Make sure you have PHP 5.x or higher.


Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from share.ez.no,
you will find the various versions at:

http://share.ez.no/download

NOTE: You will only require eZ Publish 4.x or higher (if you have a more recent version)

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.6/Installation
and
http://doc.ez.no
http://share.ez.no


Installing BC Role hasPolicy Kernel Override extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcrolehaspolicykerneloverride-0_0_1.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcrolehaspolicykerneloverride-0_0_1.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings/override/. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcrolehaspolicykerneloverride

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcrolehaspolicykerneloverride

4. Regenerate all autoloads

   ./bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -o

   ./bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -e

   ./bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v

5. Enable eZ Publish kernel class overrides in config.php

   Edit / Create the config.php file (named 'config.php-RECOMMENDED' by default)

   define( 'EZP_AUTOLOAD_ALLOW_KERNEL_OVERRIDE', true );

6. Clear all caches

7. Use eZ Role class normally and the hasPolicy method as needed in any eZ Publish PHP context


Usage
==============================

Example PHP usage (Any eZ Publish PHP context be it cli, module view, class, kernel override, etc)

This works for any PHP context when the kernel overrides direct usage of eZRole class to the kernel override extension eZRole class provided instead directly and with all required standard eZRole usage retained completely (no deviation in expected or desired behavior only new helpful functionality)

Here is a most basic use case PHP snippet which has been successfully tested to perform as expected

$anonymous = eZRole::fetchByName('anonymous');

if ( $anonymous->hasPolicy( 'content', 'create' ) )
{
    echo 'has content,create policy';
}
else
{
    echo 'does not have content,create policy';
}

echo "\n\n";

if ( $anonymous->hasPolicy( 'content', 'read' ) )
{
    echo 'has content,read policy';
}
else
{
    echo 'does not have content,read policy';
}
